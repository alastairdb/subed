Format-specific modes are now initialized with =(subed-srt-mode)=,
=(subed-vtt-mode)=, or =(subed-ass-mode)= instead of the corresponding
=(subed-vtt--init)= functions.

I implemented the format-specific functions with =cl-defmethod=, so if
you have any code that refers to functions like
=subed-vtt--timestamp-to-msecs=, you will need to change your code to
use generic functions such as =subed-timestamp-to-msecs=.
