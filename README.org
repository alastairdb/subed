* subed
subed is an Emacs major mode for editing subtitles while playing the
corresponding video with [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]].  At the moment, the only supported format is
SubRip ( ~.srt~).

subed is still alpha software.  Expect it to kill your Emacs session.

** Features
   - Quickly jump to next (~M-n~) and previous (~M-p~) subtitle text.
   - Quickly jump to the beginning (~C-M-a~) and end (~C-M-e~) of the current
     subtitle's text.
   - Insert (~M-i~) and kill (~M-k~) subtitles.
   - Freely adjust subtitle start (~M-[~ / ~M-]~) and stop (~M-{~ / ~M-}~) time.
   - Freely move subtitle without changing its length (~C-M-n~ / ~C-M-p~).
   - Sort and re-number subtitles and remove any extra spaces and newlines
     (~M-s~).

*** mpv integration (optional)
   - Open videos with ~C-x C-v~ or automatically when entering subed-mode if the
     video file is named like the subtitle file but with a video extension
     (e.g. ~.mkv~ or ~.avi~).
   - Every time the buffer is saved, the subtitles are sanitized, sorted, etc
     and then reloaded in mpv.
   - Cursor and playback position are synchronized:
     - Playback in mpv seeks to the position of the current subtitle as the
       cursor moves between subtitles (~C-x ,~).
     - The cursor is moved to the currently relevant subtitle as the video is
       playing (~C-x .~).
   - Playback is paused or slowed down when a subtitle's text is edited (~C-x
     p~).
   - Loop over the current subtitle in mpv (~C-x l~).
   - When a subtitle's start or stop time changes, mpv seeks to the subtitle's
     start time (~C-x /~).

** Installation
   For now, you have to install it manually.  For example, copy ~subed/*.el~ to
   ~~/.emacs.d/elisp/~ and add ~~/.emacs.d/elisp/~ to your ~load-path~.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (use-package subed
     ;; Tell emacs where to find subed
     :load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/"
     :config
     ;; Disable automatic movement of point by default
     (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'subed-disable-sync-point-to-player)
     ;; Break lines automatically while typing
     (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill))
     ;; Break lines at 50 characters
     (add-hook 'subed-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local fill-column 50)))
   #+END_SRC
